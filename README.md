# Better Vanilla Creepers

This resource pack changes the texture of **creepers** and **charged creepers** to resemble the ones used in **Minecraft Dungeons** and **Minecraft Legends**, while keeping the look and feel of vanilla Minecraft.

Made by Lorenzo Federici ([@LorenzoF06](https://reddit.com/user/LorenzoF06/) or [@lore.federici](https://instagram.com/lore.federici)).

# Requirements

#### Minecraft

The pack is designed for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.20.4 and should be compatible with older versions as long as OptiFine is supported.

This resource pack **doesn't** work on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

#### OptiFine

In order to change the appearance of the charged creeper, this resource pack **requires OptiFine** or any other mod that supports [random entities](https://optifine.readthedocs.io/random_entities.html). It will still function without OptiFine, but the result will be less pleasing.

It has been tested with OptiFine HD U I7 for Minecraft 1.20.4, but should also work with any other OptiFine version.

Please note that it **may not be compatible** with future Minecraft versions, as the old *NBT tags* have been replaced by the new *components* in Minecraft 1.20.5, and there is currently no OptiFine support for versions 1.20.5, 1.20.6, 1.21, or 1.21.1.

# Credits

This pack was inspired by [this](https://redd.it/1dpaduy) Reddit post by [u/Able_Health744](https://reddit.com/user/Able_Health744/), which is based on this [post](https://x.com/M_i_t_t_s/status/1804950100864623092) on X by [@M_i_t_t_s](https://x.com/M_i_t_t_s).

The creeper texture is based on the Minecraft Dungeons creeper texture posted on [Planet Minecraft](https://planetminecraft.com/mob-skin/minecraft-dungeons-creeper-texture/) by [EnderKill](https://planetminecraft.com/member/enderkill/).

The charged creeper texture is based on [this](https://planetminecraft.com/mob-skin/charged-creeper-better-in-3d-minecraft-dungeons/) texture on Planet Minecraft by [Roll_eG](https://planetminecraft.com/member/roll_eg/), and is also inspired by [this](https://redd.it/j7l23v) Reddit post by [u/NivolasFedrizzi](https://reddit.com/user/NivolasFedrizzi/). Both textures are likely based on the Minecraft Dungeons [charged creeper](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft_Dungeons:Creeper?file=Charged_Creeper_%28Dungeons%29.png).
